# sql-experiments

Experiments in Flix to generate SQL.

Currently just an incomplete implementation of Ezra Cooper's query 
comprehension normalization and translation to SQL presented in the paper _The script-writer's 
dream: How to write great SQL in your own language, and be sure it will
succeed_. Plus some experiments working towards completing Cooper's translations.
